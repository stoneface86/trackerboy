The tempo calculator is a utility dialog for calculating speed values from a
given tempo. You can access it from the *Tempo Calculator...* action in the
[Song](menus/song.md) menu.

You can change either the tempo or speed spinbox to your desired setting and
the opposite will be automatically updated.

When you are satisfied with the calculated speed you can click the *Set song
speed* button to set it to the current song's speed setting.
